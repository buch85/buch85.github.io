</table><p/><p>An orc's hair usually is black. It has lupine ears and reddish eyes.

Some orcs know Goblin or Giant as well.</p><p>Most orcs encountered away from their homes are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Orcs are proficient with all simple weapons, preferring those that cause the most damage in the least time. Many orcs who take up the warrior or fighter class also gain proficiency with the falchion or the greataxe as a martial weapon. They enjoy attacking from concealment and setting ambushes, and they obey the rules of war (such as honoring a truce) only as long as it is convenient for them.</p><div level="8" topic="Light Sensitivity"><p><b>Light Sensitivity (Ex):</b> Orcs are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a <i>daylight</i> spell.</p>

Half-orcs usually inherit a good blend of the physical characteristics of their parents. They are as tall as humans and a little heavier, thanks to their muscle. They have greenish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and coarse body hair. Half-orcs who have lived among or near orcs have scars, in keeping with orcish tradition.</p><div level="8" topic="Half-Orc Traits"><p><b>Half-Orc Traits (Ex):</b> Half-orcs possess the following racial traits.</p><ul>
