</table><p>Doppelgangers are strange beings that are able to take on the shapes of those they encounter.

Its large, bulging eyes are yellow with slitted pupils. A doppelganger's appearance is deceiving even when it's in its true form. A doppelganger is hardy, with a natural agility not in keeping with its frail appearance.</p><p>Doppelgangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society.
