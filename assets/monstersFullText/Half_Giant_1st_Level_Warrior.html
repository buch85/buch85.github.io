</table><p>Half-giants typically stand from 7 feet to nearly 8 feet tall and weigh from 250 to 400 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women.</p><p>Half-giants speak Common. Many also learn Giant.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Because of their giant ancestry, half-giants are able to use weapons sized for creatures larger than normal humans. They gain considerable satisfaction in using these large weapons in combat against their foes.</p><div level="8" topic="Psi-Like Abilities"><p><b>Psi-Like Abilities:</b> 1/day: <i>stomp</i> (DC 10). Manifester level equal to 1/2 HD (minimum 1st). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Fire Acclimated"><p><b>Fire Acclimated (Ex):</b> Half-giants have a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against all fire spells and effects.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Powerful Build"><p><b>Powerful Build (Ex):</b> The physical stature of half-giants lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category.</p><p>The half-giant warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.</p>
